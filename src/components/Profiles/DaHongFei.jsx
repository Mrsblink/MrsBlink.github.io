    text: 'You are Da Hongfei, the People\'s Republic of China comes to you for advice. This should be enough for anyone, but no... you get to be described as "a Bachelor of Arts graduate capable of coding virus with assembly language" and hailed as charismatic visionary the likes of Steve Jobs. Must be tough. You are a founder of NEO blockchain platform often called "Chinese ethereum" (a top 10(ish) cryptocurrency in the world) and blockchain service provider Onchain that dropped Onthology on us (dropped... he he nailed it). Not doing too bad I guess. Many achievements and accolades are behind you but what lies ahead? A harsh battle with fierce competition while navigating stringent and rigorous Chinese regulators. The roadmap is long and wrought with many challenges. But as once the great Justin Sun said "Be water my friend!" and the prize will be within your grasp (we call it "the prize" because "government compliant blockchain solution that meets requirements of private business" kind of messes with the cadence of the sentence). Oh did we also mention that you like nOS? Well you do! You think it rocks!',
