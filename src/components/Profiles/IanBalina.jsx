While most of us are unable to leverage our university diplomas to get the jobs we are qualified for you parlayed Instagram photos of your blockfolio into a position of the biggest influencer in the world of crypto. Damn, not bad for once a peddler of corporate enterprise software. Every project you endorse is a moon mission fueled by hordes of your followers chasing the dream of retirement at the ripe age of 26. Heck when talking about moons you created more of them then DBZ characters destroyed! (this anime reference was totally not forced!) You got hacked... honestly we would make fun of you more if we didn\'t keep our private keys in TXT files ourselves. And what is a few millions lost for Midas of crypto? You will simply descend among the shitcoins touch a few and make some (fool\'s) gold. All in a day\'s work. ',
