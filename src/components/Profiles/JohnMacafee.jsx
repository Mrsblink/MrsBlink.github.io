    text: 'Your name is John McAfee! You were born in Britain, moved to America and was employed by NASA, Booz-Hamilton, Lockheed to name a few. At Lockheed, you got a copy of Brain virus and were asked to write software to combat computer viruses. In 1987 you founded the anti-virus company McAfee Associates (Very creative in naming your company) in Santa Clara, California. In 1994, you resigned and sold all your stake after McAfee went public. At one point you were worth 100 million dollars! You did great until then since you were not on drugs! You became a Libertarian and started smoking weed and other drugs. Bad combination. You were wanted as a "person of interest" in your neighbor\'s murder in Belize from where you fled. Your noisy, opulent life in Belize came to an end. You ran away from Belize, but could not run away from yourself. You were left with little money now and someone introduced you to crypto. You saw a way to make your money back. Became a pump and dump kingpin in the wild, wild west of crypto. You became the Trump of crypto world!. Talk nonsense, tweet nonsense! You even charged $100K for one tweet to shill a coin. You are now exposed. People don\'t want to touch the ICO/Coin that you talk about with a 10 foot pole. You are back in your hole .. probably smoking more weed',
