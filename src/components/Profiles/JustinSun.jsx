The first Chinese emperor Qin Shihuang claimed his empire in A brutal and extremely bloody war campaign, Emperor Kangxi established his empire via a shrewd politics, able administration, military prowess and championing Chinese arts... And you? You have built your multi-billion empire using a twitter account and a photo opportunity with Jack Ma. That is not just savvy, that is Jack Sparrow meets McGuyver kind of savvy. You\'ve been accused of plagiarism, dumping 6 billion TRX and having a really annoying online presence yet your project marches on promising the future and delivering successes such as that game with digital dogs that have melted ice creams on their heads. Come to think of it, that right there is crypto in a nutshell. We would never make fun of your announcements, that\'s low hanging fruit! What would we do? Stay tuned, we will release the details later this week, it will be amazing!',
