    text: "Your name is Roger Ver. You ran for political office. That did not work out so you started your business career by selling fireworks straight out of Sergio Leone's movies. Alas, peddling \"firecrackers\" with more then twice the legal limit of explosive powder sort of makes you arms dealer and you spent several months in federal prison. And now? Now you are successful entrepreneur and crypto millionaire. If that is not an American dream story that what is? Actually... this is a Saint Kitts and Nevis story! Being a great fan of brown pelicans, cricket and no taxation for world-wide income you became a proud citizen of this West Indies paradise. You are one of early investors in bitcoin. You did well investing in seed rounds of such ventures as Kraken, Coinlab and Ripple. You once promoted bitcoin with such a fiery passion that you were anointed \"Bitcoin Jesus\". But then you were enlightened and figured out that Bitcoin Cash is the true bitcoin. That was not received well and you were called \"Bitcoin Judas\". That's a lot of New Testament for a bunch of progressive abstract thinkers... Honestly these nicknames suck. As far as we know neither Jesus nor Judas flip-flopped on their beliefs. Do you know who did? Snoop Dogg! He was a Muslim, a Mormon(surprising!), a Rastafari(unsurprising!) and he is probably not done. \"Bitcoin Snoop Dogg\" has a nice ring to it...",
