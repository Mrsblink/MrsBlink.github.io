    text: 'Your name is Roger Ver. Your life was an interesting one. You didn’t talk to a lot of women or go to a lot of parties in your high school years, did you? You were too scared and anxious to make social interaction with people so you got your mother to let you drop out as you played video games and ... touched yourself as you watched adult films all throughout your teenage years. One day, as you threaded through the unending forests of the internet, you noticed a video named ‘What is Bitcoin?’ on the right of your screen under the Suggested Videos panel on YouTube. You click it, thinking it’s a fun new game to play. Instantly, you are amazed.<br>' +

    'You’ve been suffering from OCD your entire life, and you find something that calms your nerves and helps you cope with your mental illness. The balance and simplicity of the Bitcoin logo made you feel good on the inside. Bitcoin and yourself became a perfect match. You began investing in Bitcoin, funding Bitcoin startups and amassing domains that are related to Bitcoin. You became obsessed. Eventually, people began seeing value in the concept of cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrencies began going more and more mainstream, with retail investors around the world showing significant interest in a new form of value transfer.<br>' +
    'The year is now 2017. Things don’t look so good for you. For years, you saw the Bitcoin logo and thought were able to synchronize with the blockchain in some way. I don’t quite know what that means - you’re pretty weird. Alas, you decided it was time for a change. Your OCD begins to return because you cannot resonate with the way the Bitcoin looks any further. You created a new paradigm - a new form of value transfer - BCash. In this paradigm shift, you tilt the Bitcoin logo so it’s tipping to the right rather than to the left. This soothed your hormones and your mind - allowing you to find spiritual peace. This is a new era. The era of Bcash.',
