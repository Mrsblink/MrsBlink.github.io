Congratulations on having amassed a little bit of money; now try not to get a big head (figuratively or literally) about it like your namesake. Bragging about making money in 2017 crypto market is like making-out with your homeschool teacher your senior year then expecting to pull some serious tail when you go to State University. Congratulations & good luck in the future, Bro!\n' +
    'Speaking of getting lucky; you are the crypto equivalent of Bill Cosby in a trojan horse. Navigating the crypto-space requires cunning and critical thought. With your chipper disposition and toothy smiles you lower the defenses of your faithful followers. In the still of night while defenses are down out pops mothafucking Bill Cosby ready to deliver the poison pill via another $10 udemy course or perpetual shillings of BitDegree. You weave a poison web with your words and countless crypto enthusiasts bare your scars & embarrassingly confess to one another that they once listened to you. You’ll continue to be a waning presence in the crypto-space misattributing the expansion of your portfolio during market bull-run as result of your unique understanding of the market; the high tide lifts all the ships in harbor, but it also raises bloated corpses as well. My bologna has a first name and it’s S-U-P-P-O.',
