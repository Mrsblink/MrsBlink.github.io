    text: 'Your name is Vitalik Buterin. Where to even begin... You are a prodigy, an accomplished olympian (yeah, we know it was Olympian in Informatics... it still counts!), coder and radical thinker. Unlike Loch Ness monster you even managed to get your hands on three fiddy (per article!). And oh yeah, you created Ethereum, a $30.000.000.000 (+-9.41%) market cap project ushers an era of decentralized applications. Even the reports of your death were greatly exaggerated! Your hometown proudly lists your name next to admirals, cosmonauts and speed skaters! Thanks to you Forbes needs to find only 29 people for it\'s "30 under 30" list (for next 6 years anyway). Not a bad haul for a 24 year old! What is your net worth? Does it really matter? You already own all the unicorn t-shirts (yes, all... period). You are really in it for the tech, in a non-ironic sense. We get it! (Narrator: No they do not) Instead of tending to your portfolio you rather tackle interdisciplinary conundrums and build like... a world-wide computer. I am sure AIs will appreciate it when they finally turn on us. Sure, you sold some ETH early and philanthropy is an expensive hobby but there is still a wallet or two to tie you over. It has like 1000, no 30.000, no... Hummm you\'d have to check...',
